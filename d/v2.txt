A fully abstract class containing only abstract methods (Java 8: default, static also allowed).

Q14. Difference between abstract class and interface?
Abstract Class	Interface
Has concrete + abstract methods	Only abstract methods (before Java 8)
Can have constructors	No constructor
Single inheritance	Supports multiple inheritance
🔵 6. CONSTRUCTORS
Q15. What is a constructor?

A special method used to initialize objects.

🔵 7. SWING
Q17. What is Swing?

A lightweight GUI toolkit providing controls like JFrame, JButton.

Q18. Difference AWT vs Swing?

Swing is lightweight, platform-independent

AWT is heavyweight, depends on OS

🔵 8. CLASS & OBJECT
Q19. What is a class?

A blueprint/template for objects.

Q24. What is JVM?

Java Virtual Machine — runs Java bytecode.

Q25. What is JDK?

Java Development Kit — tools + compiler + JRE.

Q26. Relationship?

JDK ⟶ includes JRE ⟶ includes JVM.

Platform independent, Object-oriented, Secure, Robust, Multithreaded, Portable, High performance.

🔵 Extra Definitions
Instantiated meaning

Creating an object using new.

Abstract method

A method without body.

Concrete method

A method with full implementation.



API stands for Application Programming Interface.

👉 It is a set of pre-written classes, methods, and rules provided by Java (or any software) so that developers can reuse functionality without writing code from scratch.
